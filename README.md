# My react webpage
This repository is nothing more than a cool little practice project which helped with practicing react concepts.
This project uses only functional components with hooks such as:
- useState
- useEffect
- useContext

## About the webpage
The webpage is a mock of a traditional Mexican food (sort of) online order web-app.
it loads a basic menu from a firebase backend using the fetch API and renders it.

## The future of this project
I will continue this project as it helps me become a better web-developer, 100% on my own, no collaborators are added but suggestions are always welcomed. (but never on the foods!!)


### Can i clone this repository?
*Of course, that is what open source github is for!*
